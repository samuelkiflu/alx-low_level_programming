# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
## 0. \_putchar
Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.
* The program should return 0
## 1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
* Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
*  can only use \_putchar twice in your code
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
## 2. 10 x alphabet
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: void print\_alphabet\_x10(void);
* You can only use \_putchar twice in your code
## 3. islower
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
* Prototype: int \_islower(int c);
* Returns 1 if c is lowercase
* Returns 0 otherwise
## 4. isalpha
Write a function that checks for alphabetic character
* Prototype: int \_isalpha(int c);
* Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
* Returns 0 otherwise
## 5. Sign
Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
* Prototype: int print\_sign(int n);
* Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
* Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
* Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero
## 6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
* Prototype: int \_abs(int);
## 7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
* Prototype: int print\_last\_digit(int);
* Returns the value of the last digit
## 8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life
Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
* Prototype: void jack\_bauer(void);
* You can listen to this soundtrack while coding :)
## 9. Learn your times table
Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
* Prototype: void times\_table(void);
* Format: see example
## 10. a + b
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
* Prototype: int add(int, int);
## 11. 98 Battery Street, the OG
Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: void print\_to\_98(int n);
* Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
* Numbers should be printed in order
* The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
* The last printed number should be 98
* You are allowed to use the standard library
